Please download ESP idf integrated development environment of Espressif Company to compile the code, the version is 4.4.4
1.	Install the ESP-IDF tool installer
Download the IDE and IDF from the link

2.	Run the downloaded executable file to get the IDE and IDF installed on your system
During the installation, you can change the default ESP IDF installation path, which will be used later.
